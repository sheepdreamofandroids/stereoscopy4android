This is a trivial eclipse project. Just add your own libraries.


## Fix the build path ##

To avoid any copyright issues, I haven't included the android.jar nor the specific jars for LG or HTC. Simply fix the build path using the paths pointing to my own harddisk. After that the project should build.

This is not an android project since the output is a jar, not an apk. Therefore the android.jar has been included by hand.
